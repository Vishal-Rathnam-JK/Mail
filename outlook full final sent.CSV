We have Aakash and Vishal joining our team. They are new to our group. To enable smooth transition and getting up to speed, I wish to assign one buddy for each of them.

 

Jeelani will be buddy for Aakash.

payment = (rate + rate / (1 + rate)^months – 1 ) * amount where rate is the annual rate divided by 1,200 (that is, 6 % has rate = .005) and the carat character means “raised to the power of.” The syntax to use the power function is

"Re: Opportunity in EAS","Hi,




The only reason I'm seeing not to take up this opportunity is the cost of living in Bangalore . I cannot manage to afford relocating this year as i have taken a loan which requires that i pay 65% of my monthly compensation as monthly installment until the end of this year . And it's really hard to manage with the remaining 35% of my salary in a city like Bangalore . I hope you understand my situation .




However, if you really think that i should not pass up this opportunity , please let me know your thoughts . I would be willing to reconsider my decision . Thanks .

Hi All,

 

As you may be aware, Europe’s new privacy law, known as the General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR, comes into force effective May 2018.  The GDPR introduces extensive changes regarding the handling of information relating to individuals and applies to both customers and service providers.

 

As part of this compliance initiative , we are supposed to complete the  below e-learning which gives a high-level introduction to the General Data Protection Regulation, focused on what the law is and its business impact. This short eLearning course is recommended for all Cognizant associates.

Subject: Six Months… Are you Ready? Countdown to GDPR

 

 



 

The GDPR countdown continues …only 6 months left to go!

How can I make sure my client account is GDPR ready? 

Follow the checklist for every account and take the Gap Analysis training, available on the GDPR microsite <https://compliance.cognizant.com/Privacy>  to understand where you are today compared to where you need to be by May 2018. 

 

I work in a corporate function – do I have to do anything?

Corporate functions also have to prepare for GDPR and more details will be issued shortly. In the meantime, check out the GDPR microsite <https://compliance.cognizant.com/Privacy>  which has information and for corporate functions.

Kindly approve my submitted leaves.

"RE: Request to apply comp off leave for June 28th as I'm on notice period","Hi Anand/Monisha,

 

I had already spoken with you about my disinterest in the work carried out in this project and more specifically by my team on the beginning of April month.

I’ve said that this work here is of no growth to me and I feel like working at an Non-Voice BPO project rather than an IT project. One of the major reasons for me submitting my resignation is the quality of the nature of the work being done here is sub-par. I have been trained as a dotnet full stack developer and I will not continue to do such trivial work being assigned to me here. I will only carry out work that is done by a full stack developer. If you feel that I’m following the trend of being unproductive it is because the work being assigned to me is trivial. I don’t find working in a spreadsheet, monitoring abends and creating documents for requesting jobs as interesting. I am capable of far more challenging work than that and willing to learn any new technology to carry out said such challenging work. My role here is not allowing me to do that. I’m the kind of person who clocks in extra time without being asked if I find the work I’m doing is interesting, but the case here is I’m kind of being coerced into working more than 9 hours and on weekends too. For me project standards, personal and career growth are of far greater value than money, and none of my expectations are even remotely met here. If you’re considering converting the days I’ve clocked in from last Thursday (7/12) as LOP, please go ahead and convert the remainder of Notice period as LOP too.

Hi Sanjiv – We may look into the option of converting non productivity of Vishal as LOP. We are seeing this trend from last Thursday (7/12)..

Hi Sanjiv,

 

As discussed in person, can you please help in getting the approvals necessary to update the leave for June 28th as comp off worked for June 9th at backend as I cannot submit any leaves as I’m serving my notice period currently. I have attached the approved compensatory off email for your reference.

"FW: Your Last working date has been auto-updated - Requesting early release","Hi Sanjiv/Monisha,

 

Good Morning. I am reaching out to you requesting an early release which will be helpful for me to join my college which will begin tentatively on August 1st week. I have written the TANCET 2018 exam and have secured the 204th rank overall and 124th community rank. My counselling is on July 30th, where I will get the college based on my rank. I’m hoping to land Anna University or University of Madras which are most likely to begin on the first or second week of August. I have attached a screenshot of my rank list and my counselling call letter.

Could you please help me in getting the necessary approvals for an early release as the current LWD(September 7th) would mean that I would miss a good deal of college time. Please let me know if any additional documents are required from my end to process this request.

"A Huge loss befalls Cognizant","September 7th, 2018. Cognizant is losing its most pivotal resource in history. I bestow upon you,

my underlings, this opportunity to showcase your skills and keep Cognizant afloat in my absence.

 

I've never been one for cheesy words and emotional goodbyes, but I feel like some things have to be said.

My time here of 20 months have given me memories to cherish and moments with people that I'll be 

wistful of over the years to come. I have learnt a lot from each of you as have each of you from me.

Some of the best times of my life that I had, I had it with you people.

 

My time in Mainframe training is an unforgettable experience to me. We had the best trainer who understood

us. We used to enjoy coming to work on Saturdays. The times we had playing truth or dare, all the 

chats, playing UNO, carrom all seem like they just happened. Our trip to MGM was the one which most of us had 

come and I know how hard it was to get the ones coming to actually make it. I'm glad it happened though.

My trips to Nagallapuram was with the closest of you people and I will always hold it close to me.

I also had fun with our numerous visits to the beach and restaurants. I always felt like that strengthened

our ever-growing bond.

 

Then came the dreadful day on which we had to split into separate batches. I was gradually okay with it,

as I had the chance to meet some new friends, with whom I eventually became closer to. It was with them

that I embarked upon my first project to, and it is with them that I am currently taking breaks with.

 

There comes a time in everyone's life where they have to take step in another direction, eventhough some will

think it is not the right decision. At moments like these, listen to what your heart says and decide based on

your instincts. Only you know what is right for you and what makes you happy. Always prioritize happiness and

relationships over success and wealth. I wish for all of you to be successful in whatever you choose to do,

and hope that we cross paths professionally or personally somewhere down the road.

 

Unfortunately, I cannot address everyone individually here, eventhough I so badly want to. I wish 

we had spent more time together, I have so many things left unsaid. But I'm going to stop here as

I reminisce and decide that I'm elated that it happened and not gloomy that it has end.

 

                THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING A PART OF MY LIFE. KEEP IN TOUCH.

                                                            

P.S. This message is BCCed to the people I care about.

 

XOXO
